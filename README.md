# The Name
## Meaning
Pharus means lighthouse. Lighthouses are designed to keep ships away from the rocks, much like how Pharus is meant to keep a speakers away from common public speaking pitfalls. 

## Pronunciation
Far - us

# Purpose
All great speakers use body language to demonstrate confidence and increase trust.
There is a wealth of advice on good body language. However, the issue is putting this advice into practise. 

While giving a speech, most of the bad habits with body language  are unconscious and deeply engrained (e.g. touch face or crossing arms). Often the only time we know we do these things is when someone else points it out. Pharus is here to be your person speaking coach that gives instant feedback on a speech as you give it. Use while practising your next presentation or even keep it running discreetly whilst on a video call.
